Try it
------

Integrity provides a quick and easy way to try it out locally. The database is
saved into `$HOME/.integrity.db`.

    $ gem install integrity thin do_sqlite3
    $ integrity launch
    $ open http://0.0.0.0:4567/

Please see our [website][] for deployement instructions.

Why we don't `require "rubygems"`
---------------------------------

We decided to leave that choice up to the user. For more information, please
see [Why "require 'rubygems'" In Your Library/App/Tests Is Wrong][rubygems]
