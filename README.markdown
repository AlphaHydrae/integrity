Integrity
=========

Integrity is your friendly automated Continuous Integration server.

It's fully usable from within its web interface (backed by [Sinatra][]), 
allowing you to add a project, set preferences for it (where's the code 
repository, is it completely private or public, etc), and run the build command
from there.

It has been designed with ruby projects in mind, but any project that can be
tested in an unix-y fashion (with a command line tool that returns 0 on success
and non-zero on failure) works with it.

Integrity works out of the box with [git][] projects, but support for other 
SCMs like [Subversion][svn] is planned.

Getting Started
===============

Clone the source from our [git repository][repo]:

    gem install dm-core dm-more data_objects do_sqlite3 sinatra json haml sr-sinatra-diddies
    git clone git://github.com/foca/integrity.git
    cd integrity
    git submodule update --init
    cp config/config.sample.yml config/config.yml
    $EDITOR config/config.yml
    rake db:migrate
    bin/integrity

Now you can go to http://localhost:4567, add your first project, and enjoy
safer coding, with integrity.

If you want automatic commit processing, you currently need to be using
[GitHub][]. Click the edit link on your GitHub project, and add an integrity
link that looks like the following to the `Post-Receive URL` field:

    http://integrity.domain.tld/projectname/push

Configuration
=============

The `config.yml` only needs two settings:

* `database_uri`: this should be a complete connection string to your database.
  For example `mysql://user@localhost/integrity` (you need an `integrity` db
  created in localhost, of course).
* `export_directory`: This is where your project's code will be checked out to.
  Make sure it's writable by the user that runs Integrity.

Resources
========

We have a [Lighthouse account][lighthouse] where you can submit patches or
feature requests. Also, someone is usually around [#integrity][irc-channel] on
Freenode, so don't hesitate to stop by for ideas, help, patches or something.

Future plans
============

* [Twitter][]/[Campfire][]/[IRC][] bots
* More general support for git (only git: urls are supported for now)
* Other SCMs like Subversion

Development
===========

The code is stored in [GitHub][repo]. Feel free to fork, play with it, and send
a pull request afterwards. 

In order to run the test suite you'll need a few more gems: [rspec][], [rcov][]
and [hpricot][]. With that installed running `rake` will run the specs and
ensure the code coverage stays high.
